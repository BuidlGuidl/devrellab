## 🔥👛 Burner Wallets

Wallet safety and also more efficient/fast when you’re building/testing.

#### Why?
- Burner wallets add safety and they accelerate the application development process.
- They are more secure because you don’t have to worry about your real wallet credentials and worry about the safety.
- Faster transaction and easy to use since there’s no download.

#### What?
- Burner wallets are like any other crypto wallet, only they are not permanent. They are created and used for specific purposes such as minting NFTs or making transactions on a dApp. You can transfer your funds from your real wallet to the burner wallet, and use the burner wallet for a specific purpose.
- For example if you’re going out for dinner you can get a burner wallet and charge it however much you need to and then throw it away.
- They are throw-away wallets

#### How?
- Real life demo (send with a scan)
- Example: Nifty ink ⇒ artist no need to create one
- (Web2 to Web3 course) ⇒ wallet generate random. Local storage.
- Show the SE-2: new approach

#### Closing notes:

- Remember  that your burner wallet is temporary and shouldn’t be used as your primary wallet address.
