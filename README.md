Burner wallets are like any other crypto wallet, only they are not permanent. They are created and used for specific purposes such as minting NFTs or making transactions on a dApp. You can transfer your funds from your real wallet to the burner wallet, and use the burner wallet for a specific purpose. For example if you’re going out for dinner you can get a burner wallet and charge it however much you need to and then throw it away.

Burner wallets add safety and they accelerate the application development process. They are more secure because you don’t have to worry about your real wallet credentials and worry about the safety.

Always remember  that your burner wallet is temporary and shouldn’t be used as your primary wallet address.
